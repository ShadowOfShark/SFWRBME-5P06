The design team, stakeholders, disciplinary co-instructor(s), and lead instructor(s) will conduct monthly meetings to review the design progress. Meeting minutes should include the date, participants, version/revision of the reviewed design, results, and action items.

Stakeholder feedback forms must be signed (the instructor feedback forms do not).

Replace [DATE] with the YEAR-MONTH-DAY of the meeting (e.g., 2024-09-20 5P06 Instructor Meeting Feedback Form)
