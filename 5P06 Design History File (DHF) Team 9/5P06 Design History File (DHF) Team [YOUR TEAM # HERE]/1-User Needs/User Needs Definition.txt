User needs formulate what the user wants, and arise from asking questions

The user needs can be thought of as a vague set of wishes expressing what customers would like a product to do for them
• Some needs are stated by the user (based on answers to questions)
• Other needs may be identified by the designer; these are unarticulated, or latent needs

Your team must establish a list of customer requirements informed by user needs and constraints relevant to the framed problem.  

User needs are often broad statements that are difficult to measure. In Design Inputs, you will make user needs more specific. 

You WILL revisit and refine the user needs throughout the project. This is an iterative process.

Note: Risk Identification is an important part of your Design Input (but not the only part!).
